          <div id="dentist2">
            <p>Temping as a dentist is a win, win for a new graduate. Our biggest compliment from our temporary dentists are they take something valuable from each office. This gives them a chance to see how a dental office is actually operated and they experience , different philosophies, product used, management styles, benefits they offer their staff, marketing techniques, and what they will take or leave from the experience. ( the good, the bad and the ugly) We have two state of the art dental schools in North Carolina: UNC Dental School in Chapel Hill and ECU Dental School in Greenville.</p>

          <p>The first person anyone sees in a dental office is your front office staff. They are the face of the office and will be an integral part of the dental team. Organization, communication and excellent customer service skills are of the utmost of importance. Dental software varies from office to office so good computer skills are a must. Whether you are on the job trained or a seasoned receptionist, financial coordinator, insurance specialist, office manager, we can help you find the right position. This is generally a position that is a permanent placement, but we do list maternity leaves and sick leaves for temporary placement. It’s a tough position to place on a daily basis.</p>

        <h2>Quality Over Quantity</h2>
        <p>Many of our new clients ask me, why are you different? Many of our regular clients will tell you it’s the commitment to matching the right candidate to the right practice. We believe in the uniqueness of every office and candidate. This is why we value our “face to face” interviews with each dental professional working with us. We feel this is integral to our success of providing quality dental staffing. We realize, not only does the candidate represents us, more importantly they represent our clients to their customers.</p>

        <p>Whether you’re a practice looking to hire their next employee or a dental professional looking for their next permanent position, we have always recommend working interviews. Many years ago this was not the practice. Today, it’s key to ensuring the proper fit and harmony in any practice. Our model that has been developed with decades of success is for the potential new hire to work in the office for a day or two. After the choice is made, we guarantee that permanent placement with a 30/60 day limited guarantee.</p>

        <p>We are proud to serve the dental community with awesome staff through constant recruiting and the building of relationships. If you’re in the dental community today and are ready to make a change, please feel free to reach out to Advance Dental Associates Inc. by emailing mindy@advdentaltemps.com.

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8">
          <p>Mindy Lazear Gill is a graduate from West Liberty University with a BA degree. My career in the dental field started with Hygiene Associates Inc. in Rockville, Maryland, under the direction of Pamela Lazear Quinones, RDH. What began as a 6-month temporary job quickly turned into a lifelong passion with dental staffing. Together we made a great team, Pam’s passion for dental hygiene and staffing built a successful business helping dental offices in the Metro area to realizing their full potential.</p>

          <p>After 11 years in the Washington DC Metro area, my husband took a transfer to Raleigh, NC. During the initial years I spent time getting my children settled into school and volunteering where needed in many school functions. Though I was very active in my children’s early development, I never lost interest in the dental community. After several years of careful planning, it was time to bring the Hygiene Associates’ model to the Raleigh area by opening the doors to Advance Dental Associates Inc.</p>

          <p>Today, I am active in the NC Dental Community. I’m a current member of the Durham-Orange Hygiene Association. ADA Inc. supports, exhibits and sponsors at the meetings of the NC Dental Society, NCAGD, NCDHA, NCMOMs, TADS, The Cleft Palate Gallop 5K and the AADOM Triangle Chapter.</p>

          <p>In summary, communities are what we make of them. The active involvement and volunteering makes NC Dental Communities one of the best in the nation.</p>
