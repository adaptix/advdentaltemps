      <h3>Quality Over Quantity</h3>
      <p>Many of our new clients ask me, why are you different? Many of our regular clients will tell you it’s the commitment to matching the right candidate to the right practice. We believe in the uniqueness of every office and candidate. This is why we value our “face to face” interviews with each dental professional working with us. We feel this is integral to our success of providing quality dental staffing. We realize, not only does the candidate represents us, more importantly they represent our clients to their customers.</p>

      <p>Whether you’re a practice looking to hire their next employee or a dental professional looking for their next permanent position, we have always recommend working interviews. Many years ago this was not the practice. Today, it’s key to ensuring the proper fit and harmony in any practice. Our model that has been developed with decades of success is for the potential new hire to work in the office for a day or two. After the choice is made, we guarantee that permanent placement with a 30/60 day limited guarantee.</p>

      <p>We are proud to serve the dental community with awesome staff through constant recruiting and the building of relationships. If you’re in the dental community today and are ready to make a change, please feel free to reach out to Advance Dental Associates Inc. by emailing mindy@advdentaltemps.com. We’re looking forward to serving you.</p>

    <h3>About Mindy</h3>
    <img src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/img/placeholder-logo.png" alt="Advanced Dental Associates, Inc. logo.">
    <p>Mindy Lazear Gill is a graduate from West Liberty University with a BA degree. My career in the dental field started with Hygiene Associates Inc. in Rockville, Maryland, under the direction of Pamela Lazear Quinones, RDH. What began as a 6-month temporary job quickly turned into a lifelong passion with dental staffing. Together we made a great team, Pam’s passion for dental hygiene and staffing built a successful business helping dental offices in the Metro area to realizing their full potential.</p>

    <p>After 11 years in the Washington DC Metro area, my husband took a transfer to Raleigh, NC. During the initial years I spent time getting my children settled into school and volunteering where needed in many school functions. Though I was very active in my children’s early development, I never lost interest in the dental community. After several years of careful planning, it was time to bring the Hygiene Associates’ model to the Raleigh area by opening the doors to Advance Dental Associates Inc.</p>

    <p>Today, I am active in the NC Dental Community. I’m a current member of the Durham-Orange Hygiene Association. ADA Inc. supports, exhibits and sponsors at the meetings of the NC Dental Society, NCAGD, NCDHA, NCMOMs, TADS, The Cleft Palate Gallop 5K and the AADOM Triangle Chapter.</p>

    <p>In summary, communities are what we make of them. The active involvement and volunteering makes NC Dental Communities one of the best in the nation.</p>
